Command line pull of multiple branches from one repository: 

$ git checkout master
$ git fetch origin +pu:pu maint:tmp
$ git pull . tmp

This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches pu and tmp in the local repository by fetching from the branches (respectively) pu and maint from the remote repository.

If the optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a fast forward update.
Thus pu branch will be updated even if it is does not fast-forward; the others will not be.

The final command then merges the newly fetched tmp into master.
