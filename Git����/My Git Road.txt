1. How to : 在学校和寝室同时对一个课题进行研究，并利用GitHub做同步和备份。
	Steps:
	A. Create a new repository in GitHub
	
	B. Create your local repository.
	
	C. In your local repository, add your GitHub repository as a remote, and then Push.
	cd [existing_git_repo]
	git remote add origin [Your Clone Url in GitHub]
	git push origin master
	
	D. To Backup in another place, go to the backup direcotry, and then use git-clone command
	cd [bakup_dir]
	git clone [Your Clone Url in GitHub]
	# this will create a dir of your project name, and clone a repository from the GitHub's repository

	E. To Synchronize repository from remote
	cd [repository need synchronize]
	git pull [remote] master
	
	
	
	Concepts:
	A. work may simultaneously proceed along parallel lines of development, called branches, which may merge and diverge.
	
	B. Branch
	A single git repository can track development on multiple branches. 
	It does this by keeping a list of heads which reference the latest commit on each branch.
	The "git-branch" command shows you the list of branch heads.
	
	Example:
	Administrator@61C69CF8BED9407 /d/PrjPlay/gitlearning
	$ git branch
	boss
	* master
	
	C. Tag
	A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry chain.
	
	git-tag - Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html
	Example:
	$ git tag -l <pattern>
	List tags with names that match the given pattern (or all if no pattern is given). Typing "git tag" without arguments, also lists all tags.
	
	D. Checkout Help:
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html
	Example:
	$ git checkout -b new v2.6.13
	# This command will create a branch named "new". Note that v2.6.13 is a tag.
